# BookStore MVVM TECHNOLOGY

In addition to the application I developed before, MVVM and Hilt were added. <br />
https://github.com/tubakoc/BookStoreApp <br />
In summary, this developed application consists of two screens. <br />
All books, their names and prices are listed on the first screen. <br />
The books listed also stand out with the visual added next to the best-selling price information. <br />
On the second screen, all the details of the clicked book are listed. <br />
In addition, the requested APIs and the returned response information can be examined with the chucker library added to the application.
